A machine can be constructed to compute the sequence 010101....
The machine is to have the four m-configurations " b " , " c " , " Â£ " , "c : >
and is capable of printing " 0 " and " 1 ". The behaviour of the machine is
described in the following table in which " R " means "the machine moves
so that it scans the square immediately on the right of the one it was
scanning previously". Similarly for "L". "E" means "the scanned
symbol is erased" and " P " stands for "prints". This table (and all
succeeding tables of the same kind) is to be understood to mean that for
a configuration described in the first two columns the operations in the
third column are carried out successively, and the machine then goes over
into the m-configuration described in the last column. When the second
column is left blank, it is understood that the behaviour of the third and
fourth columns applies for any symbol and for no symbol. The machine
starts in the m-configuration b with a blank tape.
